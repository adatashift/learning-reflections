## Overview
As part of my transition into data analytics and business intelligence, I completed the IBM SkillsBuild Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals course to build a grounded understanding of how AI systems work — and, just as importantly, how they affect real people and institutions.

Rather than focusing only on technical capabilities, this course challenged me to think critically about ethics, bias, accountability, and human oversight in AI-driven systems. One of the strongest takeaways was that many of the risks associated with AI are not technological failures, but reflections of human decisions, data quality, and system design choices.

## Key Insights
1. **AI systems reflect human bias**  
   AI models learn from human-generated data and often replicate existing inequalities. This reinforced the importance of scrutinising data sources — a principle that directly aligns with analytics and reporting work.

2. **Ethical considerations must be embedded early**  
   Fairness cannot be “fixed” at the end. Bias can enter at every stage of the lifecycle, mirroring best practices in project management and impact reporting.

3. **Human accountability remains essential**  
   Over-reliance on automated decisions is a critical risk. AI should support, not replace, human judgment — especially in decisions affecting finance, access, or opportunity.

4. **Accuracy does not guarantee fairness**  
   A technically accurate model can still produce unfair outcomes if based on historically unequal patterns. Performance metrics alone are insufficient.

5. **Diverse teams reduce ethical blind spots**  
   Ethical AI is socio-technical. Multidisciplinary teams better identify risks and design inclusive systems.

## Application to My Career
This course strengthened my ability to:
- Assess data and AI tools through both technical and ethical lenses
- Contribute to discussions on responsible data use
- Align analytics work with fairness, transparency, and accountability

I now approach AI as a tool that must be intentionally designed, governed, and evaluated to deliver value without reinforcing harm.
